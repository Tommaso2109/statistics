                <h2>What is statistics, and why can it be useful for cybersecurity?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Statistics can be thought of as the science of making sense of data.
                    At its core, it provides methods to collect information, organize it,
                    and then analyze it in order to draw meaningful conclusions.
                    Unlike raw numbers, which may appear overwhelming and chaotic,
                    statistics helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships
                    that are otherwise invisible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    It is not only about counting or calculating averages,
                    but also about reasoning under uncertainty:
                    making predictions, estimating probabilities,
                    and deciding which patterns are significant
                    and which are just noise.
                    </p>

                <h2>Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>
                    <p>
                    In the field of <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, this perspective is especially valuable.
                    Modern organizations generate an enormous amount of data every second:
                    network traffic logs, authentication attempts, email communications,
                    system alerts, and user activities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Much of this data is normal and harmless,
                    but hidden within it may be the subtle traces of an attack or intrusion.
                    The challenge for cybersecurity professionals
                    is to distinguish the normal background “noise”
                    from the suspicious signals.
                    Here statistics plays a crucial role:
                    it gives analysts tools to describe what is typical
                    and to recognize when something falls outside the usual pattern.
                    </p>

                <h2>Example: Network Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>
                    Consider the case of network monitoring.
                    Under ordinary conditions, the number of login attempts to a system
                    follows a predictable rhythm, shaped by working hours or weekly schedules.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Using statistical models, analysts can capture this normal baseline.
                    If, suddenly, there is an unusual spike—say, hundreds of login attempts
                    in a short window—statistics helps determine whether this is
                    a random fluctuation or a strong indication of a brute-force attack.
                    </p>

                    <p>Other examples where statistics can help in cybersecurity include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Unusual amounts of outbound data may suggest data exfiltration</li>
                    <li>Unexpected traffic patterns could reveal a botnet</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                    Another reason why statistics is powerful in cybersecurity
                    lies in <strong>risk assessment</strong>.
                    Security teams constantly face decisions about
                    where to allocate limited resources:
                    which vulnerabilities to patch first,
                    which threats are more urgent,
                    or how to balance costs and benefits.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Statistical methods allow them to estimate probabilities,
                    to quantify the likelihood of different attack scenarios,
                    and to evaluate the potential impact.
                    Instead of relying on intuition alone,
                    decision-makers can base their strategies on measurable evidence.
                    </p>

                <h2>Reducing False Positives</h2>
                    <p>
                    Moreover, statistics enhances the precision of detection systems.
                    A naïve approach that raises an alarm for every irregularity
                    would overwhelm analysts with false positives,
                    burying real threats under a mountain of irrelevant alerts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    By applying statistical thresholds carefully,
                    or by using probabilistic models that adjust to new data,
                    systems can strike a better balance:
                    sensitive enough to catch attacks,
                    but selective enough to avoid constant noise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This balance is what makes anomaly-based intrusion
                    detection systems effective in practice.
                    </p>

                <h2>Forensic Investigations</h2>
                    <p>
                    The usefulness of statistics extends to forensic investigation as well.
                    After a breach, analysts need to reconstruct what happened, when, and how.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    By applying statistical clustering methods,
                    they can group together related events—
                    such as similar login attempts from multiple IP addresses—
                    revealing coordinated activities
                    that would not be obvious from isolated records.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Graph analysis, supported by statistical similarity measures,
                    can help map the relationships between compromised hosts,
                    malware families, and attacker infrastructure.
                    </p>

                <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>
                    <p>
                    Of course, there are challenges.
                    Statistical methods rely on data,
                    and if that data is incomplete, biased, or manipulated,
                    conclusions may be misleading.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Attackers can even attempt to mimic normal patterns
                    to blend into the background,
                    making statistical detection harder.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Furthermore, what counts as “normal” behavior evolves over time:
                    new applications are installed,
                    user habits shift,
                    network traffic grows.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This phenomenon, known as <strong>concept drift</strong>,
                    means that statistical models must be updated regularly
                    to remain accurate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    For this reason, many modern approaches combine statistics
                    with machine learning techniques
                    that adapt automatically to changing environments.
                    </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                    Despite these challenges, the contribution of statistics
                    to cybersecurity is undeniable.
                    It transforms massive, complex datasets into structured knowledge,
                    allowing professionals to detect hidden threats,
                    to prioritize defenses, and to evaluate
                    the effectiveness of their strategies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In a landscape where cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated
                    and data volumes are ever-growing,
                    statistical thinking becomes not just useful,
                    but essential.
